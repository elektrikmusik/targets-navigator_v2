# Feature Specification: Global Application Shell (Sidebar, Header, Theming, Status Panels)

**Feature Branch**: `003-specify-create-this`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description:
"""
/specify create this layout and theming that should be used inherited by all pages in our app.
The layout combines a responsive expandable sidebar using Aceternity UI, payment/status data elements from Ceres Power, and a structured header and search field inspired by Tailwind UI's application shells sidebar. **Lucide icons** are recommended for all sidebar and utility links for a cohesive, modern aesthetic.[1][2]

### Sidebar Layout Structure

- **Expandable Sidebar:** Uses Aceternity UI’s sidebar, supporting expand-on-hover, animation (toggleable with `animate`), theming (dark mode, mobile responsiveness), and custom child content.[1]
- **Links and Icons:** Sidebar links display labels, hrefs, and Lucide icons, wrapped with the SidebarLink component or similar, for navigational clarity.[1]
- **State Management:** Sidebar’s open/close logic uses the `SidebarProvider`, passing `open` and `setOpen` props down to children, ensuring global sidebar state across the app.[1]
- **Context:** Providers and context hooks (`SidebarContextProps`) ensure agents can access sidebar visibility and set its state from anywhere.[1]

### Theming & Visual Style

- **Dark Mode Support:** The entire sidebar and header are theme-aware, supporting dark mode toggling, using Tailwind classes responsive to the theme context.[1]
- **Lucide Icons:** All navigation and utility actions use Lucide icons, which are lightweight, customizable, and blend seamlessly with Tailwind for sizing and colors.[1]
- **Consistent Spacing & Fonts:** Utilize Tailwind utility classes for padding, gaps, font-weight, and rounded corners, mirroring Tailwind UI’s shell design.[1]

### Header and Search Field

- **Header Placement:** The header sits above or beside the sidebar depending on the viewport, typically aligned vertically or horizontally with the sidebar for cohesion.[1]
- **Search Field:** The header includes a floating or inset search input styled with Tailwind (`input`, `rounded`, `px-4`), positioned for quick access and visible at all breakpoints.[1]
- **Profile/Status:** Widgets, status, and action icons (using Lucide) can be placed on the header’s right for accessibility and functional grouping.[1]

### Ceres Power Data Panel (Adapted)

- **Main Area:** Content panels (like payment/status, user lists) use clean card containers and grids inspired by Ceres Power’s layout, leveraging Tailwind for structure (`grid`, `gap-x-4`, shadows, hover effects).[2]
- **Status Colors:** Statuses (success, pending, failed) employ color-coded tags or badges, applying Tailwind’s badge utilities (`bg-green-500`, `bg-yellow-500`, etc.) for clarity.[2]

### Component-Level Props Summary

| Area           | Key Prop/Hook                | Essential Purpose                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Sidebar        | `open`, `setOpen`           | Controls expansion/collapse                   |
| SidebarLink    | `link`, `icon`, `className` | Enables navigation with Lucide icon           |
| SidebarProvider| `open`, `setOpen`           | Contextual state across layout                |
| Theme          | Tailwind, dark mode classes | Adapts visuals for user theme preference      |
| Header/Search  | Responsive Tailwind classes | Input, action icons, grid alignment           |

### Usage Guidance for Agent

- Always wrap application shell with `SidebarProvider` to inherit sidebar state across routes.[1]
- For Lucide icons, import and use icon JSX in SidebarLink and header action buttons for visual consistency.
- Align header and sidebar layouts per Tailwind UI patterns, ensuring responsive and theme-aware adaptation.
- Use status and card grids for main content inspired by Ceres Power demo, styling with Tailwind for clean separation.[2]

This approach ensures **flexible theming**, global sidebar state, and unified navigation/icons throughout the app.[2][1]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the application, I always experience a consistent, responsive application shell with a left navigation that can collapse/expand, a top header with a prominent search, and content panels that clearly communicate item/payment/status states using color-coded badges. The shell supports light/dark themes and preserves my preferences across pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the app is loaded on desktop, When I hover over or toggle the sidebar, Then the navigation expands/collapses smoothly and remains usable.
2. Given the app is loaded on mobile, When I open the sidebar, Then it overlays appropriately and can be dismissed via a close action or tapping outside.
3. Given I am on any page, When I type into the global search field and submit, Then the app navigates to a global results view searching Companies and Dossiers by name, ticker, and tags, ranked by relevance.
4. Given I switch theme, When I navigate between pages or refresh, Then my theme preference persists across sessions for at least 30 days.
5. Given the main content shows items with different lifecycle states, When I view them, Then I see clear status indicators (success, pending, failed) with consistent colors and labels.
6. Given the sidebar is collapsed, When I navigate using icons only, Then tooltips or accessible labels communicate destination names and keyboard navigation remains fully operable.
7. Given assistive technologies are used, When I traverse the shell via keyboard/screen reader, Then focus order is logical, landmarks are present, and controls are labeled.

### Edge Cases
- Very narrow viewports: Sidebar remains accessible without obstructing header or content; search remains discoverable.
- Long navigation labels or many items: Overflow handled gracefully without layout breakage; navigation supports up to two levels with section group headers.
- Touch devices: "hover to expand" behavior adapts to touch-friendly alternatives.
- No network or slow connections: Shell renders skeleton/placeholder gracefully; icons and layout do not shift unexpectedly.
- High-contrast and dark modes: Status colors maintain sufficient contrast ratios.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a global, responsive application shell present on all pages.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST include a left navigation that supports collapsed and expanded states with a clear affordance to toggle.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST expose a global state for navigation visibility so any page/module can read and modify it.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a BD manager or analyst, I need to quickly discover, score, and prioritize companies for partnerships, licensing, investments, and market expansion, with transparent rationales and evidence, so that I can confidently create shortlists, drill into dossiers, compare peers, and share/export polished reports with stakeholders.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a new session, when I filter by sector, geography, revenue band, ownership type, hydrogen readiness, and IP activity, then I see a paginated/virtualized list updating under 1.5 seconds with accurate counts and the ability to sort by overall or any pillar score.
2. Given a company in the list, when I open its dossier, then each tab (Overview, Finance, Industry, IP, Manufacturing, Ownership, Hydrogen) displays the current score, a rationale snippet, top contributing features, and working evidence links.
3. Given multiple companies, when I add up to five to compare, then I see a comparison table with pillar scores, rationale hints, and sector/geo medians, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and I can export the comparison.
4. Given selected companies and tabs, when I build a report, then a branded PDF export is generated including rationales, benchmarks, and evidence citations.
5. Given scores are sourced directly from the database, when viewing lists, cards, and dossiers, then scores are read-only, always current, and require no sync-status UI; no in-app score or weight editing is possible.
6. Given benchmarks are available for a sector/geo, when viewing dossier and compare, then medians are shown; when not available, a clear "benchmark not available" state is displayed.
7. Given sparse or missing data, when a pillar has insufficient inputs, then the UI clearly labels "insufficient data" and shows last verified timestamps and source links where available.

### Edge Cases
- Empty or overly broad filters return many results: list remains responsive with virtualization and clear messaging on applied filters.
- No results match filters: show an empty state with guidance to adjust facets.
- Benchmarks unavailable for a sector/geo: show a clear "benchmark not available" state with guidance.
- Missing media (e.g., logo): fall back to initials placeholder without layout shift.
- Compare selection beyond five: prevent the sixth selection with a helper message.
- Role without permission attempts access to restricted content: display access-denied messaging consistent with policy.
- Slow network or data freshness lag: show skeleton loaders and last verified timestamps; avoid blocking the workflow.
- Evidence link unavailable: show graceful fallback and allow alternate sources where defined.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 Global layout**: Provide a responsive layout with header (search and global actions), left facets panel, main list/content area, and a sticky compare/export bar; adapt to 2‚Äì3 column grids based on viewport.
- **FR-002 Filtering & sorting**: Support multi-facet filtering by sector/industry, geography, revenue bands, ownership type, hydrogen readiness, and IP activity. Allow sorting by overall score or any pillar score.
- **FR-003 List performance**: The targets list loads in under 1.5 seconds for the current dataset using an optimized overview and virtualization/pagination for responsiveness.
- **FR-004 Company cards**: Each card shows logo, name, website, geography, tags, a sparkline for overall score trend, color-coded pillar badges with tooltips, and actions: "View Dossier", "Add to Compare", and an evidence link.
- **FR-005 Read-only scores**: Scores are sourced directly from the authoritative database and are read-only in the UI. They are always current at view time; no sync-status or last-sync display is required. No in-app scoring or weight editing is available.
- **FR-006 Dossier tabs**: Provide tabs for Overview, Finance, Industry, IP, Manufacturing, Ownership, and Hydrogen. Each tab displays the latest score, rationale snippet, top contributing features, and evidence links.
- **FR-007 Benchmarks**: Display sector/geo medians where available within dossier and compare views; peer benchmarks are out of scope for now.
- **FR-008 Compare mode**: Allow selecting up to five companies to compare side-by-side with pillar scores, rationale hints, and medians; highlight strengths/weaknesses; enable quick export.
- **FR-009 Report builder**: Enable assembly of selected companies and tabs into a branded PDF export including rationales, benchmarks, and evidence citations.
- **FR-010 Provenance & freshness**: Display source URLs, last verified timestamps, and clearly indicate "insufficient data" states; provide a data dictionary modal describing surfaced fields.
- **FR-011 Performance & UX polish**: Include skeleton loaders, keyboard-first filter navigation, accessible color/contrast, light/dark theme, and subtle micro-interactions to reinforce actions.
- **FR-012 Access & security**: Enforce role-based read policies aligned with defined data access rules across pillar content.

### Non-Functional and Success Criteria
- **NF-001 Performance**: Targets list initial render under 1.5 seconds for ~500 records; interactions remain under 100 ms median.
- **NF-002 Accessibility**: Meets WCAG AA contrast and keyboard navigability for filter and list interactions.
- **NF-003 Reliability**: Evidence links and timestamps displayed for ‚â•95% of records where available; clear fallback for missing.
- **NF-004 Usability**: Compare selection discoverable within two clicks; exports produced without configuration errors.

### Assumptions & Defaults
- **Branding and exports**: Use the Tweakcn theme colors and typography as baseline. Exports are PDF-only (A4, portrait, 16 mm margins), with app name "Targets Navigator" as header text (no custom logo provided). Footer shows generation date and page x of y. Single-company dossier and compare views are exportable.
- **Default sort and tie-breakers**: Default sort is `overallScore` descending. Tie-breakers: `abilityToExecute` desc, `strategicFit` desc, then `name` ascending for stability.
- **"Insufficient data" thresholds**: A pillar shows "insufficient data" if (a) its pillar score is null, or (b) fewer than 50% of required inputs for that pillar are present, or (c) the pillar `evaluation_date` is older than 24 months.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Company**: A target organization with identity, geography, website, tags, composite and pillar scores, and evidence provenance.
- **Pillar Score**: A category score (Finance, Industry, IP, Manufacturing, Ownership, Hydrogen) with rationale snippet and contributing features.
- **Compare Set**: A transient selection of up to five companies for side-by-side analysis and export.
- **Report**: A branded export artifact composed of selected companies and tabs, including rationales, benchmarks, and citations.
- **Score Metadata**: Read-only metadata describing the scoring versioning and updated_at timestamps stored in the database.
- **Evidence**: One or more source citations supporting scores and rationales, each with a URL and last verified timestamp.
- **Benchmark**: Sector and geography reference statistics used for medians and percentile positioning.
- **User Role**: An access profile determining visibility of content and administrative controls.
